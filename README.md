##Features
Selection of Organs: Users can choose between Left Kidney, Right Kidney, or Liver.
Parameter Inputs: Various parameters such as Total Count, Time Point in Hours, Time per Projection, Number of Images, Volume, and calibration factor can be entered.
Calculation of Absorbed Dose: Upon user request, the app calculates and displays the absorbed dose for the chosen organ.
